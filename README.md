Voxa is designed to be more than just a chatbot. It’s a smart assistant powered by Google’s FLAN-T5, a cutting-edge transformer model capable of understanding complex queries and generating natural, human-like responses. Unlike rule-based bots, Voxa can learn from context and adapt to different types of customer issues—whether it’s about refunds, faulty products, or order tracking.
